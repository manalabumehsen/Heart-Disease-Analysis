# Heart Disease Analysis Project

## Overview
This project analyzes key risk factors for heart disease using patient data from Kaggle.  
Python and Power BI were used to explore risk levels, visualize patterns, and create interactive dashboards.

## Tools
- Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn)  
- Power BI  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## Files
- `heart_disease_analysis.ipynb` – Notebook with all code and analysis  
- `heart_disease_final.csv` – Cleaned dataset  
- `presentation.pptx` – Project slides  
- `README.md` – Project overview  

## Project Steps
1. Load the dataset and check for missing values.  
2. Clean data and rename columns for clarity.  
3. Explore data using visualizations (Histogram, Boxplot, Heatmap).  
4. Classify patients into Low, Medium, and High risk levels.  
5. Visualize distributions and risk levels.  
6. Build interactive dashboards in Power BI.  

## How to Run
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter.  
2. Install required Python libraries:  
```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn
